# aura
Spaced repetition Spanish vocabulary learning tool to automate Anki deck creation with Fuentes' *Aura* in mind.
My vision is to be able to read a book in another language without stopping, and with noticeable improvement in vocabulary while away from the desk.
Anki is a mobile app and AnkiWeb can be used to sync progress to the user's cloud.
```bash
$ aura give
(S=1071,P=10,L=25-30): "la puerta cede al empuje levísimo, de tus dedos, y antes de entrar miras por última vez sobre tu hombro, frunces el ceño porque la larga fila detenida de camiones y autos gruñe,"
$ aura try -s 1071 "the door opens at the lightest push, of your fingers, and before entering you for the the last time about your shoulder, you furrowing your brow at the long line of groaning trucks and cars"
#TODO: aura progress data response
